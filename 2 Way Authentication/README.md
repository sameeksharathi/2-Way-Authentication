# Fine-Grained-Two-Factor-Access-Control-for-Web-Based-Cloud-Computing-Services
Implemented with the necessity of both a user secret key and a lightweight security device, enhance the security of the system, especially where many users use a single public system.

We introduce a new fine grained two factor authentication (2FA) access control system for web based cloud computing services. Specifically, in our proposed 2FA access control system, an attribute-based access control mechanism is implemented with the necessity of both a user secret key and a lightweight security device. As a user cannot access the system if they do not hold both, the mechanism can enhance the security of the system, especially in those scenarios where many users share the same computer for web based cloud services. In addition, attribute based control in the system also enables the cloud server to restrict the access to those users with the same set of attributes while preserving user privacy, i.e., the cloud server only knows that the user fulfills the required predicate, but has no idea on the exact identity of the user. Finally, we also carry out a simulation to demonstrate the practicability of our proposed 2FA system.
